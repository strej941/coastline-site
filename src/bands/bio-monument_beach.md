**Monument Beach**, formerly known as Help! Police!, is a Tampa based ska punk 
band created in 2015 by friends and veterans of the Florida ska scene. With a rocking three piece brass line and a driving rhythm section, they will make you love ska again with their unique sound. Their debut album "Ska Shack" dropped in early 2019.
